# Basic-Banking-System

The Basic Banking System is a simple web application that allows users to perform banking transactions such as logging in, creating an account, depositing funds, and withdrawing funds. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- User login: Users can log in using their username and password. If the user does not have an account, they can sign up for a new account.
- Account creation: Users can create a new account by providing a unique username and password.
- Account balance: The main page displays the user's account balance.
- Deposit: Users can deposit funds into their account by entering the desired amount.
- Withdrawal: Users can withdraw funds from their account by entering the desired amount.
- Logout: Users can log out of their account to end their session.

## Prerequisites

To run the Basic Banking System, you need a web browser that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. If you have an existing account, enter your username and password on the login page and click the "Login" button.
3. If you don't have an account, click on the "Sign up" link on the login page and enter a new username and password to create a new account.
4. Once logged in, you will be directed to the main page where you can view your account balance and perform transactions.
5. To deposit funds, enter the desired amount in the input field and click the "Deposit" button.
6. To withdraw funds, enter the desired amount in the input field and click the "Withdraw" button. Make sure you have sufficient funds in your account.
7. To log out, click the "Logout" button.

## Database

The Basic Banking System currently uses a simple file-based approach to simulate a database. User account details are stored in the local storage of the browser. Please note that this is for demonstration purposes only and not suitable for a production environment. In a real-world scenario, a server-side database management system would be used for security and scalability.
